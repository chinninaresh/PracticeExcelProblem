
Overview of Prev Project:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

IRP (IQVIA Registry Platform):
	This is a Registry Platform aimed at assisting patients with medical inquiries, appointment scheduling, and health monitoring. 
The project involved ensuring accuracy, reliability, and compliance with healthcare standards. 
The purpose of thus project is to Import data files and migrating the product related data from spreadsheets to internal database using functional mapping
and configuration changes. The project was to build an application to manage and maintain all the patient records and related info in degital format.
Patients are able to schedule their appointment with physician through portal or offline as their respective.

Roles & Resposiblities:
++++++++++++++++++++++++

	* Developing the applications/services based on business requirments, Doing Unit Testing after completing the development.
	* We followd by AGILE Methodology, we used to handle cutomers raised tickets with reporting and resolving new bugs base on 
	  customer's feedback in JIRA.

Technical Architecture:
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Frontend: HTML, CSS,JS, React
Backend: Core Java, Spring, Spring Boot, JPA and databases MySQL

It is a web application, where we use React node js with HTML, CSS and javascript for validation.
Middleware framework we use Spring Boot Maven project and default server tomcat used on developing, and also for backend interaction Hibernate nad JPA use.
Backend technology MySQL database used.
For unit testing, JUnit and for testing the request and response POSTMAN tool used.

Q) What is the Challenge you faced and how did you get sorted out?

Interoperability with External Systems:
Challenge: Integrating the platform with external healthcare systems for seamless data exchange posed technical challenges.

Solution:
Utilized standardized protocols such as HL7 and FHIR for healthcare data exchange, ensuring compatibility with external systems.
Built a modular architecture that allowed for easier integration with third-party applications and services.
Conducted extensive testing with external systems to resolve any communication issues early on.

Continuous Compliance Monitoring:
Challenge: Maintaining ongoing compliance with healthcare regulations as new updates and changes emerged was a constant concern.

Solution:

Established a compliance team responsible for staying up-to-date with regulatory changes and assessing their impact on the system.
Integrated compliance checks into the development process, ensuring that new features adhered to regulations before deployment.
Scheduled regular audits and assessments to identify any compliance gaps and address them promptly.
By proactively addressing these challenges, the project was able to create a secure, reliable, 
and user-friendly platform that effectively supported patients and healthcare providers.
